<img width="1199" height="679" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ecb3c32-5f18-4322-ab07-93d6446bdfd8" />
This single-cycle MIPS processor is designed based on the classic MIPS instruction set architecture, similar to the reference diagram commonly taught in Computer Organization courses,my implementation supports a much broader set of instructions beyond those shown in the picture
## üìö Project Overview

This repository contains the RTL design and testbench for a **Single-Cycle MIPS Processor** implemented in Verilog. The design supports a comprehensive subset of MIPS instructions covering R-type, I-type, and J-type formats. The processor executes instructions in a single clock cycle and includes instruction memory, data memory, register file, ALU, and control logic.

## üß™ Testbench

The testbench (`MIPS_Processor_tb.v`) initializes memories, drives the clock and reset, and runs through the instruction memory. It checks the output of each instruction against expected values, including register contents and program counter updates. The testbench supports verification of:

- Arithmetic and logic operations
- Load and store instructions
- Branching and jumping behavior
- Memory access with different data sizes (byte, half-word, word)
